# Events {: .page-header }

Fine Uploader's event system enables integrators to execute any operations at
almost any point in the upload process. Knowing how these callbacks work, and
when they are called, is crucial to unlocking the full potential of
Fine Uploader.

### Syntax

The following syntax is the correct way to define event handlers:

```
callbacks: {
    onDelete: function(id) {
        // ...
    },
    onDeleteComplete: function(id, xhr, isError) {
        //...
    }
}
```
